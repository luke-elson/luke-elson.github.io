I'm a philosopher at the [University of
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). Before joining
Reading in 2014, I finished my PhD in Philosophy at [UNC Chapel
Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/). Before *that* I did my BA in Maths
& Philosophy at Exeter College, Oxford. I grew up in
[Llanelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanelli), a coastal town in
South Wales.

I'm Deputy Treasurer of the [Mind
Association](https://mindassociation.org/) and 'Cybersmith' (website
manager) of the [British Society for Ethical
Theory](https://www.bset.org.uk/).


# Research

My research (and teaching) are mostly in rational choice, metaethics,
normative ethics, and some related areas.

Most of my published research focuses on a cluster of issues around
incomplete preferences, unsharp or imprecise credences, and value
incommensurability. In one sense of the word, two items are
*incommensurate* if neither is better but they are also not precisely
equally good. I've written a short introduction to incommensurability
on its [PhilPapers
page](https://philpapers.org/browse/incommensurability-of-value).

In more straightforwardly metaethical terrain, am interested in Global
Normative Nihilism, moral error theory's more aggressive sibling. Not
only categorical/external but also hypothetical/internal resons claims
are false. I argue that this view avoids (or embraces) 'companions in
guilt' responses to queerness arguments for the moral error theory,
and that it offers radical conceptual as well as metaphysical
simplicity. It *is* a depressing (nihilistic!) view, but I argue that
it won't lead to a complete loss of motivation or subjective concern,
as some have argued.

Despite nihilistic tendencies, I have lately also become more
interested in questions in normative or practical ethics, especially
environmental ethics.
