I'm a philosopher at the [University of
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). My research and
teaching are mostly in metaethics, normative ethics, and some related
areas. Before joining Reading in 2014, I finished my PhD in Philosophy
at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/). Before *that* I did
my BA in Maths & Philosophy at Exeter College, Oxford.  I grew up in
[Llanelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanelli), a coastal town in
South Wales.
