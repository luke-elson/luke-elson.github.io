I'm a philosopher at the [University of
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). My research and
teaching are mostly in metaethics, normative ethics, and some related
areas. Before joining Reading in 2014, I finished my PhD in Philosophy
at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/). Before *that* I did
my BA in Maths & Philosophy at Exeter College, Oxford.

I'm Deputy Treasurer of the [Mind
Association](https://mindassociation.org/) and 'Cybersmith' (website
manager) of the [British Society for Ethical Theory](https://www.bset.org.uk/).

I grew up in
[Llanelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanelli), a coastal town in
South Wales, and I'm married to the poet [Katie Meehan](https://www.katherine-meehan.com/).
