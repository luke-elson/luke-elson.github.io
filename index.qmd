I'm a philosopher at the [University of
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). Before joining
Reading in 2014, I finished my PhD in Philosophy at UNC Chapel
Hill. Before that I did my BA in Maths & Philosophy at Exeter College,
Oxford. I'm from [Llanelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanelli), a
coastal town in South Wales.

<!--Upcoming presentations:-->

My [research](research.html) and [teaching](./teaching) are mostly in rational choice, metaethics,
normative ethics, and some related areas.

I'm Deputy Treasurer of the
[Mind Association](https://mindassociation.org/) and 'Cybersmith'
(website manager) of the [British Society for Ethical
Theory](https://www.bset.org.uk/).

You can find my CV (as a pdf) [here](PDFs/cv.pdf).
