At the undergraduate level, I mostly teach first- and second-year moral philosophy,
and a third-year module in mediaeval philosophy. I have also in the past taught
more advanced ethics, epistemology, and logic, and every year I supervise undergraduate
dissertations and mini-dissertations on topics across philosophy.

If you are at Reading, information and readings for all can be found on Blackboard.
