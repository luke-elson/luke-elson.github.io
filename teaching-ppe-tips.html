Oct 2021 -- suggestions welcome</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Who to ask</h2>

<p>Philosophy is your home department. This means that your academic tutor is based there. But you are able and encouraged
to get heavily involved with the other two departments too!</p>

<p>Your academic tutor should be your first point of call for any questions that go beyond a single module.</p>

<p>Other people
to talk to, who are named contacts for PPE students:</p>

<ul>
<li>The PPE co-ordinator (me);</li>
<li>Dr <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/politics-international-relations/staff/alice-baderin">Alice Baderin</a> in Politics;</li>
<li>Dr <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/economics/our-staff/vivien-burrows">Vivien Burrows</a> in Economics;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_1">The structure of the degree</h2>

<p>Full-time undergraduate students at Reading take 120 credits a year.</p>

<p>You do all three subjects in part 1 (year 1 if you are full time), and then choose a &#39;pathway&#39; for the later years:</p>

<ul>
<li> You can keep all three subjects (tripartite).</li>
<li>Or you can drop down to any two (bipartite).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This means that you do not have to do all three subjects all the way through to get a PPE degree.</strong>
You just have to pass your first year (that is, meet the progression requirements). The marks from the first year
appear on your transcript, but don&#39;t count towards your degree class. For this reason we almost always advise
students to stick with it if they are struggling with one subject in the first year.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Dissertations</h2>

<p>You must do a dissertation in your third year. Be careful of dissertation proposal deadlines in the second year! Look out for emails.</p>

<p>In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>The politics dissertation has a prerequisite module in the second year. If you don&#39;t take the module, you can&#39;t do a dissetation in politics.</li>
<li>The economics deadline for dissertation proposals is early (?)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3">Special issues arising with PPE</h2>

<p>Some of the more mathematical content in years 2 and on in economics has prerequisite modules
in year 1... which as a PPE student you can&#39;t take, for timetabling reasons. If you think this might affect you, speak to your academic tutor
as soon as you can in your first year.</p>

<p>Pphilosophy Summer modules can be taught quite close to exams in your other subjects. Not a problem, just something to bear in mind.</p>
