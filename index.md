**Spring 2022 Office Hours**: Friday 10-11am in Edith Morley G65.
Drop in or [book an appointment](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/LukeElson@livereadingac.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/) (either is fine, but
booked appointments will have priority).

I'm a philosophy lecturer at the [University of
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). I grew up in Llanelli
in South Wales, and did my BA in maths & philosophy at [Exeter College,
Oxford](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/), then a PhD at [UNC Chapel
Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/), before joining Reading in 2014.

I run the [philosophy PhD at Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/PhD-programmes/phil-phd-programmes.aspx), so if you are considering an
application to study here, please email me.


My research interests are mostly in moral philosophy.
My main project focuses on a cluster of issues around incomplete
preferences, unsharp or imprecise credences, and value
incommensurability. I am working on a book arguing that these all involve vagueness,
and that seeing them as such solves a number of puzzles.

I'm also
working on a defence of Global Normative Nihilism---the theory that we
don't have any reasons or justification for anything we do or believe.
I'm especially concerned with the question of whether this is a
depressing view.

I mostly teach moral philosophy, and a third-year module in mediaeval philosophy. I have also in the past taught epistemology, metaphysics, and logic, and
every year I supervise undergraduate dissertations and
mini-dissertations on topics across philosophy.
