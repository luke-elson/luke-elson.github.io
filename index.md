# Research

My main research project focuses on a cluster of issues around
incomplete preferences, unsharp or imprecise credences, and value
incommensurability. I am working on a book arguing that these all
involve vagueness.

# Teaching

I mostly teach moral philosophy and mediaeval philosophy. I have also
in the past taught epistemology, metaphysics, and logic.

Some documents:

* Pragmatically, **students in my modules** should read these [tips
for writing an undergraduate essay](teaching/essay-tips.html) if I'll
be marking your work.

* **Dissertation and ILM students.** I'm happy to supervise these in most areas
of phiosophy---please read [this guide for my undergraduate dissertation students](teaching/dissertation-guide.html)
if you've been assigned to me.
