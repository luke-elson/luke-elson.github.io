[CV (pdf)](cv/cv.pdf)

I'm a philosopher at the [University of
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). My research and
teaching are mostly in (meta-)ethics and some related areas (for more,
please see below). Before joining Reading in 2014, I finished my PhD
in Philosophy at [UNC Chapel
Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/). Before *that* I did my BA in Maths
& Philosophy at Exeter College, Oxford.  I grew up in
[Llanelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanelli), a coastal town in
South Wales.


# Research

## Incompleteness/Unsharpness

Most of my published research focuses on a cluster of issues around
incomplete preferences, unsharp or imprecise credences, and value
incommensurability. In one sense of the word, two items are
*incommensurate* if neither is better but they are also not precisely
equally good. I've written a short introduction to incommensurability
on its [PhilPapers
page](https://philpapers.org/browse/incommensurability-of-value).

* In my book 'Mushy Reasons' or 'Vagueness in Action' (I'm unsure
about the title) which is under publisher review, I argue that these
phenomena are all vagueness. I then defend a decision rule for vague
preferences and credences, argue that this avoids some of their nasty
consequences (so-called 'value pumps') and copes with some related
puzzles, most importantly Warren Quinn's *Puzzle of the Self-Torturer*
and Spectrum Arguments for the intransitivity of 'better than'.

## Global Normative Nihilism

In more straightforwardly metaethical terrain, I have a number of
unpublished papers defending Global Normative Nihilism, which is moral
error theory's more aggressive sibling. Not only categorical/external
but also hypothetical/internal resons claims are false. I argue that
this view avoids (or embraces) 'companions in guilt' responses to
queerness arguments for the moral error theory, and that it offers
radical conceptual as well as metaphysical simplicity. It *is* a
depressing (nihilistic!) view, but I argue that it won't lead to a
complete loss of motivation or subjective concern, as some have
argued.

## Normative and Practical Ethics

Despite nihilistic tendencies, I have lately also become more
interested in questions in normative or practical ethics.

* \(Forthcoming\) A paper on healthcare marketisation and the
introduction of risk into the doctor-patient relationship. Promised to
a *Ratio* special issue on risk.

* \(Forthcoming\) 'The Only Moral Flight is My Flight', which defends
carbon offsets against charges of injustice. Promised to an *Erasmus
Journal for Philosophy and Economics* special issue on intra- and
interpersonal dilemmas in ethics and rational choice.


# Teaching

In 2023-4 I'm teaching Meaning of Life (first year), Ethical Argument
(second year), and Happy, Good, and Meaningful Lives (third year). I
have in the past also taught epistemology, metaphysics, logic, and
mediaeval philosophy.

Here are some documents for current students:

*  [Tips for writing an undergraduate essay](teaching/essay-tips.html), with
a focus on the things I look for when marking.

* I'm happy to supervise dissertations and Independent Learning
Modules (mini-dissertations) in most areas of phiosophy---please read
[this guide for my undergraduate dissertation
students](teaching/dissertation-guide.html) if you've been assigned to
me.
