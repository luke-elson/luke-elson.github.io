I can be emailed at [luke.elson@reading.ac.uk](mailto:luke.elson@reading.ac.uk).

Iâ€™m a philosophy lecturer at the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). I grew up in Llanelli in South Wales, and did my BA in
maths & philosophy at [Exeter College, Oxford](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/),
then a PhD at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/), before joining
Reading in 2014.

My research interests are mostly in moral philosophy, and concern unsharpness
or 'gaps' in our preferences, beliefs, and values. I'm also working on a defence of Global
Normative Nihilism---the theory that we don't have any reasons or justification for anything we do or believe. I'm especially concerned with the question of whether this is a depressing view.

I mostly teach moral philosophy and mediaeval philosophy. I have also in the past taught advanced ethics, epistemology, and logic.

I run the PhD in philosophy here at Reading, so if you are considering an application to
study here, please email me.
