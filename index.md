I'm a philosophy lecturer at the [University of
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). I grew up in Llanelli
in South Wales, and joined Reading in 2014---before that, I did my PhD
in philosophy at [UNC
Chapel Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/).

**Summer 2022 Office Hours:** Thursdays 9-10am in Edith Morley G65
(except week 2).

I run the [philosophy PhD at
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/PhD-programmes/phil-phd-programmes.aspx),
so if you are considering an application to study here, please email
me.

# Research

My research interests are mostly in moral philosophy.
My main project focuses on a cluster of issues around incomplete
preferences, unsharp or imprecise credences, and value
incommensurability. I am working on a book arguing that these all involve vagueness,
and that seeing them as such solves a number of puzzles.

I'm also
working on a defence of Global Normative Nihilism---the theory that we
don't have any reasons or justification for anything we do or believe.
I'm especially concerned with the question of whether this is a
depressing view.

# Teaching

I mostly teach moral philosophy, and a third-year module in mediaeval
philosophy. I have also in the past taught epistemology, metaphysics,
and logic, and every year I supervise undergraduate dissertations and
mini-dissertations on topics across philosophy.

If you are at Reading, information and readings for all can be found on
Blackboard.

## General documents for students

1.  [A guide for my undergraduate dissertation students.](teaching/dissertation-guide.html) Please read if you have
    been assigned me as your supervisor.
2.  [PPE Cheat Sheet.](teaching/ppe-cheat-sheet.html) I am co-ordinator
    for the PPE (philosophy, politics, and economics) degree. A quick
    unofficial guide for students and academic tutors about issues which
    can arise when doing these three subjects.
3.  [Tips for writing an undergraduate essay.](teaching/essay-tips.html)
    Pragmatically, worth reading if I will be the one marking your
    essay.
4.  [Rules and advice for the GRS.](teaching/grs-rules.html) Please read
    this before taking part in the Graduate Research Seminar for PhD and
    MRes students.
