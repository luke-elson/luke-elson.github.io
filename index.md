I'm a philosophy lecturer at the [University of
Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/). I grew up in Llanelli
in South Wales, and did my BA in maths & philosophy at [Exeter College,
Oxford](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/), then a PhD at [UNC Chapel
Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/), before joining Reading in 2014.

My research interests are mostly in moral philosophy, and concern
unsharpness or 'gaps' in our preferences, beliefs, and values. I'm also
working on a defence of Global Normative Nihilism---the theory that we
don't have any reasons or justification for anything we do or believe.
I'm especially concerned with the question of whether this is a
depressing view.

I mostly teach moral philosophy and mediaeval philosophy. I have also in
the past taught advanced ethics, epistemology, and logic.

I run the philosophy PhD at Reading, so if you are considering an
application to study here, please email me.
