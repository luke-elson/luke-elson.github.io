# Who to ask

Philosophy is your home department. This means that your academic tutor
is based there. But you are able and encouraged to get heavily involved
with the other two departments too!

Your academic tutor should be your first point of call for any questions
that go beyond a single module.

Other people to talk to, who are named/specific contacts for PPE
students:

-   The PPE co-ordinator (me);
-   Dr [Alice
    Baderin](https://www.reading.ac.uk/politics-international-relations/staff/alice-baderin)
    in Politics;
-   Dr [Vivien
    Burrows](https://www.reading.ac.uk/economics/our-staff/vivien-burrows)
    in Economics;
-   The support centre in Edith Morley.

# The structure of the degree

Full-time undergraduate students at Reading take 120 credits a year.

You do all three subjects in part 1 (year 1 if you are full time), and
then choose a \'pathway\' for the later years:

-   You can keep all three subjects (tripartite).
-   Or you can drop down to any two (bipartite).

**This means that you do not have to do all three subjects all the way
through to get a PPE degree.** You just have to pass your first year
(that is, meet the progression requirements). The marks from the first
year appear on your transcript, but don\'t count towards your degree
class. For this reason we almost always advise students to stick with
PPE if they are struggling with one subject in the first year: they can
always drop it later.

Whichever pathway you take, make sure that the modules you take in later
years satisfy the requirements for that pathway. Talk to your academic
tutor, the support centre or the module selection team if you are not
sure. Just because the system \'lets\' you pick a set of modules, it
doesn\'t mean that those modules are OK.

# Dissertations {#toc_2}

You must do a dissertation in your third year. Whichever one you want to
do, there will be some planning needed:

-   The *politics* dissertation has a prerequisite module in the second
    year. If you don\'t take the module, you can\'t do a dissertation in
    politics.
-   The *economics* deadline for dissertation proposals the last Friday
    of the Spring term in year 2. You can choose from a list of topics
    circulated by the economics department or propose your own topic. If
    you are considering an economics dissertation, you should speak to
    either Dr Burrows or the dissertation module convenor (currently
    Professor Giovanni Razzu) at the start of the Spring term.
-   The *philosophy* dissertation is probably the simplest to prepare
    for: a very short proposal towards the end of year 2. Since
    philosophy is your home department you will receive lots of
    announcements on Blackboard about this dissertation!

Because of the above rules, some PPE students who are doing philosophy
find themselves doing a philosophy dissertation \'of last resort\',
because they missed the deadlines for the other subject. You should
definitely not do this; it doesn\'t make anybody happy.

# Special issues arising with PPE {#toc_3}

Some of the more mathematical content in years 2 and on in economics has
prerequisite modules in year 1\... which as a PPE student you can\'t
take, for timetabling reasons. If you think this might affect you, speak
to your academic tutor as soon as you can in your first year.

Philosophy Summer modules can be taught quite close to exams in your
other subjects. Not a problem, just something to bear in mind.
