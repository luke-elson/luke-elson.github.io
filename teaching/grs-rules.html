<h1 class="title">GRS Rules and Suggestions</h1>
<p class="author">Luke Elson</p>
<p class="date">July 2021</p>
</header>
<p>(<a href="../index.html">Back to Luke’s homepage</a>)</p>
<h1 id="purpose-and-format-of-the-grs">Purpose and Format of the
GRS</h1>
<p>The Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) is a weekly venue for students to
try out their ideas, perhaps with a view to presenting in a conference,
including in a thesis, or publishing. It is 90 minutes long.</p>
<p>The format is the usual philosophical adversarial style, but the mood
should be supportive and the aim is for students to develop their work
and their skills of presenting, asking questions, commenting, and
responding.</p>
<p>Papers presented range from “here’s an idea for an argument, I just
have a detailed handout” to “it’s been accepted by a journal, let’s look
it over before I send it to be typeset”. Either is fine; most are
somewhere in between.</p>
<h1 id="for-presenters">For Presenters</h1>
<p>You should email your work to me (Luke) and to your respondent (if
you have one) <strong>one week</strong> before the GRS, to give your
respondent the weekend to read it. This deadline may be relaxed for the
first week.</p>
<p>Make sure to tell your supervisors when you are presenting. At least
one should be there.</p>
<p>You have two main choices about format:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the 3000 word <strong>conference paper</strong> model, where you
read or talk through the ideas for 30 minutes, <em>without</em> the
audience having pre-read. (You can circulate the paper if you’d like,
but the audience may not have read it.)</li>
<li>The 7500 word <strong>publication or chapter</strong> model, where
you can’t talk through the whole paper in that amount of time, but can
summarise the main points.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please don’t expect the audience to read more than 7,500 words. If
your document is longer, please unambiguously mark a 7,500 word section
for us to read.</p>
<p>The length limit has two motivations. First, in most parts of the
discipline, this is roughly the maximum length for a publishable paper
(though they may grow during the review and editing process.) Sometimes
there might be legitimate exceptions to the limit, for example a paper
in the history of philosophy that includes extensive quotes. I can’t
imagine exceptions would be common, but if you think your paper
qualifies, please discuss this with me in advance. Second, the limit
limits workload for everyone. Little is gained by having everybody read
material that there won’t be time to discuss in the seminar.</p>
<p>For accessibility reasons, you should circulate a word-processor
document (docx or odt, after runnning an accessibility check), or a
tagged PDF (modern word processors should do the tagging automatically).
Unfortunately the PDFs produced by Latex are not accessible without a
great deal of effort, so if you write in Latex you should use <a
href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> to generate a word-processor
document, and then perhaps a PDF from that.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-presenters">Advice for Presenters</h2>
<p>You don’t have to use up the entire 30 minutes. In pre-read
conferences, people generally summarise the paper for 10-15 minutes
maximum.</p>
<p>Make sure to directly answer the questions you are asked. A good way
to do this is to rephrase the question back to the asker and confirm
with them that you’ve correctly understood it. A presenter who is
uncertain will sometimes avoid the specific question and start talking
about their general project, perhaps as a retreat to safer ground.
Please try to avoid doing this.</p>
<p>You should have a visual aid. The standards are handouts or
powerpoint. I advise a handout-it’s more useful to the audience than
powerpoint. They can see the structure of the argument as a whole, have
something to take notes on, and it avoids the awkward shuffle of “can
you go back to that slide…” during questions. (Online, a presentation is
easier.) You can email me a handout if you’d like me to print it for
you.</p>
<p>You could ask someone (your supervisor or a friend) to take notes on
the discussion, so you can focus on what’s being said. Some people like
this; others prefer to keep their own notes or rely on memory.</p>
<h1 id="for-respondents">For Respondents</h1>
<p>You must get your comments to the presenter <strong>five
days</strong> before the GRS, to allow them time to respond.</p>
<p>In general, the best comments are like the best speeches at a wedding
– short. Summarise the main argument of the paper and raise one or two
objections. Most people find the summary of the argument to be the most
useful part of the comments, if only because it helps them double-check
that they didn’t misunderstand the paper.</p>
<p>Don’t feel like you have to be an expert in the area or do any
outside reading. The paper should be relatively self-contained, and
‘naïve’ questions from those who don’t know the area are often very
helpful—for the author and for the audience.</p>
<h1 id="for-other-seminar-attendees">For other seminar attendees</h1>
<p>To ask a question:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Put your hand up to ask a question on a new topic. The chair will
add you to the list.</li>
<li>To follow-up on a current debate, raise your finger. The chair may
call on you. If you ask a follow-up, you might get bumped to the bottom
of the list for substantive questions. (How exactly to raise a finger on
a webinar is an evolving norm, unfortunately.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Robust discussion is fine. But rudeness or unprofessional behaviour
isn’t. Generally the Reading GRS is great about this. But think very
hard before interrupting someone, and be aware of more subtle behaviours
like eye-rolling.</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable speaking, you can ask questions in
writing, perhaps by passing me a note.</p>
<h1 id="when-things-are-online">When things are online</h1>
<p>The main challenge with online is dodgy internet connections, which
can be a problem when someone is presenting. If you are presenting and
not completely confident about your internet, please consider
pre-recording a screencast. Less stress for all involved!</p>
<p>Screencast recording instructions <a
href="https://sites.reading.ac.uk/tel/online-teaching-toolkits/making-screencasts-for-tl/">can
be found here</a>. I have found recording screencasts using Powerpoint
Mac enraging (sometimes the audio mysteriously fails to record, and you
don’t find this out until afterwards). I have started using <a
href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a> instead, which is free and
works well. It’s not very user-friendly but your favourite obnoxious
internet personality probably uses it.</p>
