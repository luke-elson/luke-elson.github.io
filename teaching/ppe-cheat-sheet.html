<h1 class="title">PPE cheat sheet</h1>

<h1 id="who-to-ask">Who to ask</h1>
<p>Philosophy is your home department. This means that your academic
tutor is based there. But you are able and encouraged to get heavily
involved with the other two departments too!</p>
<p>Your academic tutor should be your first point of call for any
questions that go beyond a single module.</p>
<p>Other people to talk to, who are named/specific contacts for PPE
students:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PPE co-ordinator (me);</li>
<li>Dr <a
href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/politics-international-relations/staff/alice-baderin">Alice
Baderin</a> in Politics;</li>
<li>Dr <a
href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/economics/our-staff/vivien-burrows">Vivien
Burrows</a> in Economics;</li>
<li>The support centre in Edith Morley.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-structure-of-the-degree">The structure of the degree</h1>
<p>Full-time undergraduate students at Reading take 120 credits a
year.</p>
<p>You do all three subjects in part 1 (year 1 if you are full time),
and then choose a 'pathway' for the later years:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can keep all three subjects (tripartite).</li>
<li>Or you can drop down to any two (bipartite).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This means that you do not have to do all three subjects all
the way through to get a PPE degree.</strong> You just have to pass your
first year (that is, meet the progression requirements). The marks from
the first year appear on your transcript, but don't count towards your
degree class. For this reason we almost always advise students to stick
with PPE if they are struggling with one subject in the first year: they
can always drop it later.</p>
<p>Whichever pathway you take, make sure that the modules you take in
later years satisfy the requirements for that pathway. Talk to your
academic tutor, the support centre or the module selection team if you
are not sure. Just because the system 'lets' you pick a set of modules,
it doesn't mean that those modules are OK.</p>
<h1 id="toc_2">Dissertations</h1>
<p>You must do a dissertation in your third year. Whichever one you want
to do, there will be some planning needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>politics</em> dissertation has a prerequisite module in the
second year. If you don't take the module, you can't do a dissertation
in politics.</li>
<li>The <em>economics</em> deadline for dissertation proposals the last
Friday of the Spring term in year 2. You can choose from a list of
topics circulated by the economics department or propose your own topic.
If you are considering an economics dissertation, you should speak to
either Dr Burrows or the dissertation module convenor (currently
Professor Giovanni Razzu) at the start of the Spring term.</li>
<li>The <em>philosophy</em> dissertation is probably the simplest to
prepare for: a very short proposal towards the end of year 2. Since
philosophy is your home department you will receive lots of
announcements on Blackboard about this dissertation!</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the above rules, some PPE students who are doing
philosophy find themselves doing a philosophy dissertation 'of last
resort', because they missed the deadlines for the other subject. You
should definitely not do this; it doesn't make anybody happy.</p>
<h1 id="toc_3">Special issues arising with PPE</h1>
<p>Some of the more mathematical content in years 2 and on in economics
has prerequisite modules in year 1... which as a PPE student you can't
take, for timetabling reasons. If you think this might affect you, speak
to your academic tutor as soon as you can in your first year.</p>
<p>Philosophy Summer modules can be taught quite close to exams in your
other subjects. Not a problem, just something to bear in mind.</p>
