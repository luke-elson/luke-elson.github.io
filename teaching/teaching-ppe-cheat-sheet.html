Oct 2021 -- suggestions welcome</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Who to ask</h2>

<p>Philosophy is your home department. This means that your academic tutor is based there. But you are able and encouraged
to get heavily involved with the other two departments too!</p>

<p>Your academic tutor should be your first point of call for any questions that go beyond a single module.</p>

<p>Other people
to talk to, who are named/specific contacts for PPE students:</p>

<ul>
<li>The PPE co-ordinator (me);</li>
<li>Dr <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/politics-international-relations/staff/alice-baderin">Alice Baderin</a> in Politics;</li>
<li>Dr <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/economics/our-staff/vivien-burrows">Vivien Burrows</a> in Economics;</li>
<li>The support centre in Edith Morley.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_1">The structure of the degree</h2>

<p>Full-time undergraduate students at Reading take 120 credits a year.</p>

<p>You do all three subjects in part 1 (year 1 if you are full time), and then choose a &#39;pathway&#39; for the later years:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can keep all three subjects (tripartite).</li>
<li>Or you can drop down to any two (bipartite).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This means that you do not have to do all three subjects all the way through to get a PPE degree.</strong>
You just have to pass your first year (that is, meet the progression requirements). The marks from the first year
appear on your transcript, but don&#39;t count towards your degree class. For this reason we almost always advise
students to stick with PPE if they are struggling with one subject in the first year: they can always drop it later.</p>

<p>Whichever pathway you take, make sure that the modules you take in later
  years satisfy the requirements for that pathway. Talk to your academic tutor, the support centre or the module
selection team if you are not sure. Just because the system 'lets' you
pick a set of modules, it doesn't mean that those modules are OK.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Dissertations</h2>

<p>You must do a dissertation in your third year. Whichever one you want to do, there will be some planning needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>politics</em> dissertation has a prerequisite module in the second year. If you don't take the module, you can't do a dissertation in politics.</li>
<li>The <em>economics</em> deadline for dissertation proposals the last Friday of the Spring term in year 2. You can choose from a list of
  topics circulated by the economics department or propose your own topic. If you are considering an economics dissertation, you should speak
 to either Dr Burrows or the dissertation module convenor (currently Professor Giovanni Razzu) at the start of the Spring term.</li>
  <li>The <em>philosophy</em> dissertation is probably the simplest to prepare for: a very short proposal towards the end of year 2. Since philosophy is your home department you will receive lots of announcements on Blackboard about this dissertation!</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the above rules, some PPE students who are doing philosophy
  find themselves doing a philosophy dissertation 'of last resort', because
  they missed the deadlines for the other subject. You should definitely
not do this; it doesn't make anybody happy.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Special issues arising with PPE</h2>

<p>Some of the more mathematical content in years 2 and on in economics has prerequisite modules
in year 1... which as a PPE student you can&#39;t take, for timetabling reasons. If you think this might affect you, speak to your academic tutor
as soon as you can in your first year.</p>

<p>Philosophy Summer modules can be taught quite close to exams in your other subjects. Not a problem, just something to bear in mind.</p>
