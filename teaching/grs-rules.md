# GRS Rules and Suggestions

</div>

## Purpose and Format of the GRS

The Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) is a weekly venue for students to
try out their ideas, perhaps with a view to presenting in a conference,
including in a thesis, or publishing. It is 90 minutes long.

The format is the usual philosophical adversarial style, but the mood
should be supportive and the aim is for students to develop their work
and their skills of presenting, asking questions, commenting, and
responding.

Papers presented range from “here’s an idea for an argument, I just have
a detailed handout” to “it’s been accepted by a journal, let’s look it
over before I send it to be typeset”. Either is fine; most are somewhere
in between.

The GRS is 90 minutes long.

## For Presenters

You should email your work to me (Luke) and to your respondent (if you
have one) **one week** before the GRS, to give your respondent the
weekend to read it. This deadline may be relaxed for the first week.

Make sure to tell your supervisors when you are presenting. At least one
should be there.

You have two main choices about format:

1.  the 3000 word **conference paper** model, where you read or talk
    through the ideas for 30 minutes, *without* the audience having
    pre-read. (You can circulate the paper if you’d like, but the
    audience may not have read it.)
2.  The 7500 word **publication or chapter** model, where you can’t talk
    through the whole paper in that amount of time, but can summarise
    the main points.

Please don’t expect the audience to read more than 7,500 words. If your
document is longer, please unambiguously mark a 7,500 word section for
us to read.

The length limit has two motivations. First, in most parts of the
discipline, this is roughly the maximum length for a publishable paper
(though they may grow during the review and editing process.) Sometimes
there might be legitimate exceptions to the limit, for example a paper
in the history of philosophy that includes extensive quotes. I can’t
imagine exceptions would be common, but if you think your paper
qualifies, please discuss this with me in advance. Second, the limit
limits workload for everyone. Little is gained by having everybody read
material that there won't be time to discuss in the seminar.

For accessibility reasons, you should circulate a word-processor
document (docx or odt, after runnning an accessibility check), or a
tagged PDF (modern word processors should do the tagging automatically).
Unfortunately the PDFs produced by Latex are not accessible without a
great deal of effort, so if you write in Latex you should use
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to generate a word-processor document, and
then perhaps a PDF from that.

### Advice for Presenters

You don’t have to use up the entire 30 minutes. In pre-read conferences,
people generally summarise the paper for 10-15 minutes maximum.

Make sure to directly answer the questions you are asked. A good way to
do this is to rephrase the question back to the asker and confirm with
them that you’ve correctly understood it. A presenter who is uncertain
will sometimes avoid the specific question and start talking about their
general project, perhaps as a retreat to safer ground. Please try to
avoid doing this.

You should have a visual aid. The standards are handouts or powerpoint.
I advise a handout-it’s more useful to the audience than powerpoint.
They can see the structure of the argument as a whole, have something to
take notes on, and it avoids the awkward shuffle of “can you go back to
that slide…” during questions. (Online, a presentation is easier.) You
can email me a handout if you’d like me to print it for you.

You could ask someone (your supervisor or a friend) to take notes on the
discussion, so you can focus on what’s being said. Some people like
this; others prefer to keep their own notes or rely on memory.

## For Respondents

You must get your comments to the presenter **five days** before the
GRS, to allow them time to respond.

In general, the best comments are like the best speeches at a wedding –
short. Summarise the main argument of the paper and raise one or two
objections. Most people find the summary of the argument to be the most
useful part of the comments, if only because it helps them double-check
that they didn’t misunderstand the paper.

Don’t feel like you have to be an expert in the area or do any outside
reading. The paper should be relatively self-contained, and ‘naïve’
questions from those who don’t know the area are often very helpful—for
the author and for the audience.

## For other seminar attendees

To ask a question:

1.  Put your hand up to ask a question on a new topic. The chair will
    add you to the list.
2.  To follow-up on a current debate, raise your finger. The chair may
    call on you. If you ask a follow-up, you might get bumped to the
    bottom of the list for substantive questions. (How exactly to raise
    a finger on a webinar is an evolving norm, unfortunately.)

Robust discussion is fine. But rudeness or unprofessional behaviour
isn’t. Generally the Reading GRS is great about this. But think very
hard before interrupting someone, and be aware of more subtle behaviours
like eye-rolling.

If you are not comfortable speaking, you can ask questions in writing,
perhaps by passing me a note.

## When things are online

The main challenge with online is dodgy internet connections, which can
be a problem when someone is presenting. If you are presenting and not
completely confident about your internet, please consider pre-recording
a screencast. Less stress for all involved!

Screencast recording instructions [can be found
here](https://sites.reading.ac.uk/tel/online-teaching-toolkits/making-screencasts-for-tl/).
I have found recording screencasts using Powerpoint Mac enraging
(sometimes the audio mysteriously fails to record, and you don’t find
this out until afterwards). I have started using [OBS
Studio](https://obsproject.com/) instead, which is free and works well.
It’s not very user-friendly but your favourite obnoxious internet
personality probably uses it.
