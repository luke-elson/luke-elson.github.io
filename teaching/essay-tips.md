There are a million of these guides online, but here's mine. These are
specifically targeted at University of Reading students, for whom
essays are the main means of assessment. Much of this is unashamedly
tailored to my preferences, but I think they are fairly common.

First, about the choice of question. Don't be afraid of tackling the
questions that interest you and taking a strong stance on
them. Usually, the essay question is asking for *your* point of view
or assessment of the issue, and that's what gets the high (first
class) marks if done well. Most of us don't do philosophy to know what
so-and-so thought about an issue (though that is certainly important),
but also what reasons they may have had for thinking it, and whether
those reasons are decisive. Do you agree with so-and-so, and why or
why not?

You can be quite direct here. If you've given reasons to think that
(for example) the argument from relativity doesn't work, then don't
end with a weak conclusion like *in conclusion Mackie's argument is
sound but maybe not valid in today's society.* That kind of writing
provokes a "well, which is it?" response in the reader, as well as
being kind of boring to read. Is the argument sound or not? If you
think the argument fails, don't be afraid to say so!

At the start of the essay, get down to business. The question has been
asked, so you can just jump in to answer it---no need for a 'since the
dawn of time, XX has been very controversial' type introduction. This
just looks like padding, and most people hate it. Sometimes you may
need to explain why a certain issue is relevant or important, but
specific claims are usually better than sweeping vague ones.

Similarly, avoid vague "common sense" claims like 'society is getting
more diverse'. They rarely add anything important to your essay, so
better just to remove them. (Of course in some essays they will be
relevant, but in that case you'll want to add a citation or other
support for the claims.)

Most of the time, you need to present the views or arguments of others
on some issue, and then evaluate or criticise some view or
argument. It's much better to consider one or two objections or lines
of evaluation in depth (a couple of pages each) than three or four
shallowly (a couple of paragraphs each). A good way to add depth is to
anticipate (invent) lines of objection or response to what you are
saying, and this is pretty much essential to getting above a 72.

Explain everything very clearly -- write as if your reader hasn't read
the papers etc you are discussing, and doesn't know anything about the
topic. *Every* factual claim needs to be cited or otherwise supported
(unless you are saying things like 'England is in the northern
hemisphere'). Claims that someone thinks or claims something---"Singer
argues that..."---need a proper citation, including page numbers. The
point of a citation is so that the reader can go and check what you
are saying, and without the full information, they can't easily do
that.

The best way to summarise someone's views and argument is to quote then
explain: quote a couple of sentences, then explain what is being said in
your own words:

*  The quote will keep you honest---it forces you to be accurate, most
   of the time.

*  It also means you read the actual material, rather than nonsensical
   summary websites, Wikipedia, or YouTube videos, which are usually
   seriously wrong.

*  Your explanation shows that you actually understand what the author
   is saying, rather than just copying and pasting.

Be specific. For example, in an introduction, don't write "I will
evaluate whether the argument works". Write "I'll argue that the
argument fails because ..."

As that example shows, don't be afraid of 'I'. 'I think...', 'I will
argue that..' make everything far easier to read.  They also make it
clear when you are giving your own view, rather than just summarising
what others say.  It's not compulsory to write in the first person,
but in my experience it's usually the clearest option.

As a final check, try reading your essay out loud to yourself. If a
sentence sounds awkward and jarring and like something nobody would
say out loud, it's probably not a good written sentence either. But if
it sounds like something you'd say, then it probably reads nicely too!

Your paragraphs are almost certainly too long.
