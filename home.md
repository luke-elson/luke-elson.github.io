I’m a lecturer in [Philosophy at the University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/philosophy/).
Before coming to Reading, I finished my PhD in 2014 at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/).
Before that, I studied Mathematics and Philosophy at [Exeter College, Oxford](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/).

If you'd like something quick to read, in 2018 I published a [general interest piece defending carbon offsetting](https://theconversation.com/how-a-moral-philosopher-justifies-his-carbon-footprint-95809) at The Conversation.

# Publications and Research
I have a fairly wide range of research interests, but most of my work focuses on the implications of normative theories: for example, can internalism or Humeanism about reasons account about for our everyday judgements about which reasons we have? And is it a depressing theory?

I'm also developing work on the principle that 'ought implies can', and on the ethics of healthcare commissioning (purchasing).

I aim to publish my work open access, so (where available) these links are to the final, typeset version of the paper.
