# Publications and Research

At the moment I'm focusing on
two projects. The first concerns evaluative incomparability or incommensurability,
and whether it is vagueness. The second is a defence of Global
Normative Nihilism---the theory that we don't have any reasons or justification
for anything we do or believe. I'm especially concerned with the question of whether this is a depressing view.

I aim to publish my work open access, so (where available) these links are to the final, typeset version of the paper:
