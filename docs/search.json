    "text": "Suggestions and requests welcome!\nI’m glad to be supervising your dissertation! I enjoy supervision, and I’ve learnt a lot of philosophy from it.\nThis document sets out some expectations and advice. Nothing here is set in stone… it’s just how I normally do things, and some advice that I’ve picked up over the years.\nThe dissertation is far more independent than other philosophy modules. I won’t chase you up about deadlines or meetings, and it’s up to you to manage the year-long project. My role is to make comments and suggestions, and offer advice. I won’t be the main marker at the end of the year, and at the end of the day you can choose to ignore my advice—it’s your work.\nYou should take the dissertation seriously. It is worth 40 credits—because the third year is worth twice as much as the second year, it is worth four times as much as a 20-credit second-year module.\nIf this doesn’t appeal to you, why not switch to an Independent Learning Module, which counts for less and takes place entirely in the Summer? The ILM is a perfectly respectable option, and many of our best students (including several who’ve gone on to further study in philosophy) have done it. I’d urge you to consider a change now, whilst you can still easily pick up an extra module to cover the credits.\nBut if not, read on…"

    "text": "The Process\n\nYou will have submitted a short proposal early in the Summer break, and on that basis been assigned to me as a supervisor.\nYou should read a couple of books over the Summer break if possible. No need to take notes: just get familiar with some of the literature.\nAround the start of Autumn term, you contact me to discuss your topic (maybe sending me your earlier proposal), and I might ask you what you are reading, and make some suggestions. Probably if you are reading this document, this has already happened.\nThe Autumn assessed proposal sneaks up surprisingly quickly, so if you haven’t done anything over the Summer then now is the time to get reading.\nThe usual system is that you email me to arrange a meeting, attaching a draft of some work, and I’ll comment on the draft and return the document to you by email. Then at the meeting we talk through my comments.\nI need at least a week to properly read something and make comments.\nYou can send me a draft of a section, or even your summary of and reactions to something you’ve read. But please don’t send a bullet-point plan—I can only comment effectively on complete sentences/paragraphs.\nEspecially when the busy Summer term comes, I can’t read multiple drafts of the full dissertation. I will definitely read one full draft, but it’ll take me at least a week to do so, and I’ll probably have substantial comments (meaning changes for you, if you agree with my comments)."

    "text": "Advice\n\nDon’t leave it past late Spring term to write a full draft, because you might not have time to make major changes.\nDon’t forget the proposal and presentation. They count for a huge chunk of your mark, and are a good chance to get feedback from other people.\nTake ownership of the process. For example, if you’ve not written something you’re happy to discuss, email me saying so and moving the meeting back by a week or two. Meetings without anything written to discuss can often be unstructured and not very helpful.\nBut if you are feeling stuck, email me or arrange a meeting and we can talk through the issues. I’d much rather you stay in touch, whether or not you have anything written. If we chat frequently, then every meeting is low stakes and you don’t have to worry too much about whether you are on track. Often just talking about it can help with the work. (See ‘rubber duck debugging’.)\nDuring the academic year, I think if you do an hour a day of solid work (reading or writing) on your dissertation, you’ll be in a really good position.\nThink about the dissertation as 4 normal-length essays, plus an introduction and a conclusion. This will help you to maintain a clear structure, and prevent the task from being overwhelming.\nTry not to think of the dissertation as a chance to finally lay out your view on everything philosophical! The usual essay advice of covering a small topic in depth applies. The dissertation is about the length of a standard journal article, not a long book: it’s an opportunity for more depth, not more topics.\nIn an essay it might be fine to simply show that someone’s argument doesn’t work. But in the dissertation you have space to ask deeper questions: ok the argument doesn’t work as it is, but are there any tweaks that could fix it? Why, or why not?\nAs with all philosophical work, make sure to anticipate and respond to at least one line of objection. This is crucial in a dissertation, because the “I didn’t have space” excuse won’t fly.\nThe following might not apply to every dissertation, but I think it does to most: make sure your work provides an argument, with explicit premises and conclusion, perhaps numbered. If you split it into 4 normal-length essays, as above, you might imagine each of them defending a step in the argument, for example.\nDon’t be pretentious. The best bits of philosophy are (at least in my opinion) written in clear, simple language that doesn’t try to sound too ‘academic’. Use jargon if you need to, but make sure to explain what it means. The person marking the dissertation is almost certainly not an expert in the topic… you need to teach it to them, and show off your understanding in the process."

    "text": "The mechanics of writing\n\nI like handwriting the first draft of a paper. It forces me to actually type up a real second draft, rather than just fiddling with the first draft in Word. Worth considering if you get stuck, but I’m not going to read and comment on handwritten work!\nRight now, get set up with a reference manager that can keep track of citations. I like Zotero – it’s not the easiest to use, but it’s free and will manage your PDFs.\nDon’t spend ages fiddling with the introduction, then rush to do the more difficult bits. Do it the other way around! With the challenging contentful bits done, the introduction is easy.\nTry to keep everything dissertation-related in one notebook – perhaps a real paper one. All notes, plans, drafts, etc. This will prevent “I remember I read this quote but I’ve lost it…”\nIt’s very common that as you write and read, you change your mind and interests. That’s fine, so don’t worry about sticking to the original title. The final dissertation will be marked as a free-standing document, so follow your interests where they lead you.\n\nThis list might make the process seem like overwhelming drudgery. But it doesn’t have to be! The dissertation done right can finish off your degree on a high, having written and thought about a topic of your choice that fascinates you. Done wrong, you are up at 2am a week before the deadline, emailing me a first draft and hoping that I can get comments to you in time for you to make changes. I hope the tips in this document help you avoid the second scenario."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are a million of these guides online, but here’s mine. These are specifically targeted at University of Reading students, for whom essays are the main means of assessment. Much of this is unashamedly tailored to my preferences, but I think they are fairly common.\nFirst, about the choice of question. Don’t be afraid of tackling the questions that interest you and taking a strong stance on them. Usually, the essay question is asking for your point of view or assessment of the issue, and that’s what gets the high (first class) marks if done well. Most of us don’t do philosophy to know what so-and-so thought about an issue (though that is certainly important), but also what reasons they may have had for thinking it, and whether those reasons are decisive. Do you agree with so-and-so, and why or why not?\nYou can be quite direct here. If you’ve given reasons to think that (for example) the argument from relativity doesn’t work, then don’t end with a weak conclusion like in conclusion Mackie’s argument is sound but maybe not valid in today’s society. That kind of writing provokes a “well, which is it?” response in the reader, as well as being kind of boring to read. Is the argument sound or not? If you think the argument fails, don’t be afraid to say so!\nAt the start of the essay, get down to business. The question has been asked, so you can just jump in to answer it—no need for a ‘since the dawn of time, XX has been very controversial’ type introduction. This just looks like padding, and most people hate it. Sometimes you may need to explain why a certain issue is relevant or important, but specific claims are usually better than sweeping vague ones.\nSimilarly, avoid vague “common sense” claims like ‘society is getting more diverse’. They rarely add anything important to your essay, so better just to remove them. (Of course in some essays they will be relevant, but in that case you’ll want to add a citation or other support for the claims.)\nMost of the time, you need to present the views or arguments of others on some issue, and then evaluate or criticise some view or argument. It’s much better to consider one or two objections or lines of evaluation in depth (a couple of pages each) than three or four shallowly (a couple of paragraphs each). A good way to add depth is to anticipate (invent) lines of objection or response to what you are saying, and this is pretty much essential to getting above a 72.\nExplain everything very clearly – write as if your reader hasn’t read the papers etc you are discussing, and doesn’t know anything about the topic. Every factual claim needs to be cited or otherwise supported (unless you are saying things like ‘England is in the northern hemisphere’). Claims that someone thinks or claims something—“Singer argues that…”—need a proper citation, including page numbers. The point of a citation is so that the reader can go and check what you are saying, and without the full information, they can’t easily do that.\nThe best way to summarise someone’s views and argument is to quote then explain: quote a couple of sentences, then explain what is being said in your own words:\n\nThe quote will keep you honest—it forces you to be accurate, most of the time.\nIt also means you read the actual material, rather than nonsensical summary websites, Wikipedia, or YouTube videos, which are usually seriously wrong.\nYour explanation shows that you actually understand what the author is saying, rather than just copying and pasting.\n\nBe specific. For example, in an introduction, don’t write “I will evaluate whether the argument works”. Write “I’ll argue that the argument fails because …”\nAs that example shows, don’t be afraid of ‘I’. ‘I think…’, ‘I will argue that..’ make everything far easier to read. They also make it clear when you are giving your own view, rather than just summarising what others say. It’s not compulsory to write in the first person, but in my experience it’s usually the clearest option.\nAs a final check, try reading your essay out loud to yourself. If a sentence sounds awkward and jarring and like something nobody would say out loud, it’s probably not a good written sentence either. But if it sounds like something you’d say, then it probably reads nicely too!\nYour paragraphs are almost certainly too long."

In one sense of the word, two items are incommensurate if neither is better but they are also not precisely equally good. I’ve written a short introduction to incommensurability on its PhilPapers page.\nIn more straightforwardly metaethical terrain, am interested in Global Normative Nihilism, moral error theory’s more aggressive sibling. Not only categorical/external but also hypothetical/internal resons claims are false. I argue that this view avoids (or embraces) ‘companions in guilt’ responses to queerness arguments for the moral error theory, and that it offers radical conceptual as well as metaphysical simplicity. It is a depressing (nihilistic!) view, but I argue that it won’t lead to a complete loss of motivation or subjective concern, as some have argued.\nDespite nihilistic tendencies, I have lately also become more interested in questions in normative or practical ethics, especially environmental ethics."
